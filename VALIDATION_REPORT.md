# Phase 1 validation report

A rigorous check of every Phase 1 agent and main feature: does each one do exactly what it claims,
on real data, repeatably, and how fast? Everything here is measured by committed scripts, with no
LLM key (as the product ships), on 21–22 September 2026. Nothing is estimated; where something was
not re-measured, it says so.

## Verdict

| Area | What was checked | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent pipeline** | All 987 real sprints through the live analysis endpoint, at sprint end and halfway: 2,961 analyses | **Every check passed** — 0 errors, 0 invalid outputs, same answer every time |
| **Planning, Progress, Workload agents** | Every figure each reports, against an independent recount from the raw sprint | **1,974 / 1,974** match, per agent |
| **Risk agent** | Scores vs. direct graph computation; every cited node real; delay predictions vs. what each sprint really did | **1,974 / 1,974** match · **40,001 / 40,001** citations real · reproduces the published figures exactly |
| **Recommendation agent** | Every suggested reassignment applied and the risk recomputed | Predicted effect held in **1,524 / 1,524** cases; severity improved in **62%** |
| **Published evaluations** | Every one re-run from scratch | All reproduce — after fixing an evaluation clock that had silently broken one of them |
| **Roles** | Every protected endpoint × every role, read off the code | **37 × 5 = 185** checks pass — after fixing **five security defects** this validation found |
| **Features** | Test suites, the demo replay, response times | 109 + 85 + 63 tests pass; 14 / 14 demo claims; every feature responds in under a second |
| **Load** | Up to 50 people at once, 5 analyses at once, 25 simultaneous sign-ins | **0 failed requests** — after fixing **three defects** the load test found (7 failures before) |

## 1. The agents, on real data

**Method** ([`ai-service/eval/validate_phase1.py`](ai-service/eval/validate_phase1.py)). Each of the 987
eligible TAWOS sprints (31 projects; median 23 tasks, largest 119) is sent to `POST /api/v1/analyze` —
the endpoint and scope the backend uses when someone clicks **Run Analysis** — in-process, with no LLM
key. Each sprint is analysed as it stood at its end and again halfway through, and the end-of-sprint
analysis is repeated to test determinism: **2,961 analyses**. Historical sprints are moved in time so
the moment analysed is "now", exactly as the evaluation scripts pin their clocks.

### Coordinator

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Analysis completes | 1,974 / 1,974 |
| Returns all five specialist outputs | 1,974 / 1,974 |
| Same sprint, analysed twice, gives an identical result | 987 / 987 |
| Response time, in process (all 1,974) | median **23 ms**, 95th percentile **31 ms** (48 / 70 ms in the first run: timings vary with the laptop's load) |
| … for sprints under 25 tasks / 25–49 / 50–99 / 100+ | 22 / 24 / 29 / 37 ms median |

### Planning, Progress and Workload

Each agent's output is compared with a recount done independently from the raw sprint data, not with
the agent's own code — so a wrong input (the kind of bug that once made every specialist fail) would
show up as a mismatch.

| Agent | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Planning | Sprint count, task count, readiness, capacity, largest plan and risk level | 1,974 / 1,974 |
| Progress | Completion rate | 1,974 / 1,974 |
| Progress | The blocked tasks it lists as stalled | 1,974 / 1,974 |
| Workload | Team size, and exactly who is overloaded and under-used | 1,974 / 1,974 |
| All three | Output valid against its schema; no error output | 1,974 / 1,974 each |
| All three | LLM calls that reached the network without a key | **0** of 8,883 attempts — every one refused before any I/O |

**Their own verdicts, against the real outcome.** Each specialist also gives a risk level, shown to
users beside the Risk agent's. It does not feed the product's risk score, but it is scored here the
same way (a warning = anything above *low*; the 270 held-out sprints):

| Agent | Halfway: warned · precision · recall · F1 | Sprint end: warned · precision · recall · F1 |
|---|---|---|
| Risk (the product's verdict) | 205 · 0.581 · 0.902 · **0.706** | 239 · 0.552 · 1.000 · **0.712** |
| Progress | 208 · 0.582 · 0.917 · **0.712** | 81 · 1.000 · 0.614 · **0.761** |
| Workload | 144 · 0.556 · 0.606 · 0.580 | 146 · 0.555 · 0.614 · 0.583 |
| Planning | 160 · 0.456 · 0.553 · 0.500 | 166 · 0.458 · 0.576 · 0.510 |

- **The Planning agent now warns, and its warning is a weak lateness signal.** It warns when a sprint
  plans more story points than the team can finish: the capacity a manager sets in project settings,
  or else the average the team completed in its last three finished sprints (a sprint with none
  before it gets no warning). Until this validation the backend supplied no capacity, so the agent
  never warned at all. Its capacity and plan figures match the independent recount in 1,974 / 1,974
  runs. On real data it is not a good predictor of a late sprint: teams in TAWOS routinely plan more
  than they finish (80% of held-out sprints with a known capacity are over it), so the plan-to-capacity
  ratio ranks late sprints above on-time ones only a little better than chance (**AUC 0.60** halfway,
  **0.62** at sprint end, held-out) and its F1 is below simply flagging every sprint (0.66). Its
  threshold was fixed in advance, not tuned on these sprints. It is a planning check, not a delay
  predictor; the Risk agent's pace signal (AUC 0.79) remains that.
- **Progress matches the Risk agent halfway through** (0.712 vs 0.706): a plain completion-rate rule
  does as well as the pace projection. Its perfect sprint-end precision is built in — a sprint less than
  half done is late by definition.
- **Workload is a weak lateness signal**, as expected: it measures uneven load, not delay.

### Risk

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Scores and overall level equal a direct `GraphMetrics` computation | 1,974 / 1,974 |
| Every finding cites the evidence it rests on | 7,102 / 7,102 findings |
| Every cited task / person / component is a real node of that sprint's graph | **40,001 / 40,001** |
| Every other evidence reference resolves | 7,102 / 7,102 |

**Delay prediction** — the system's delay verdict (anything but *low*) against whether the sprint really
finished late (≥ 30% of its issues unresolved at the end):

| When | Projects | Sprints | Precision | Recall | F1 | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sprint end | all | 987 | 0.630 | 1.000 | 0.773 | 0.655 |
| Sprint end | **held-out** | 270 | 0.552 | 1.000 | **0.712** | 0.604 |
| Halfway | all | 987 | 0.675 | 0.957 | 0.792 | 0.704 |
| Halfway | **held-out** | 270 | 0.581 | 0.902 | **0.706** | 0.633 |

These are produced through the live API. For all 987 sprints, at both moments, every cell of the
confusion matrix is **identical** to the published evaluation scripts' results, and the held-out
figures equal their published values — so the product computes what the paper reports.
Sprint-end recall of 1.00 is structural (the label and the rule test the same condition after the
deadline); the halfway figures are the predictive ones. From the published evaluation, re-run and
unchanged: held-out AUC **0.792** halfway and **0.874** at three-quarters; F1 +0.050 and +0.099 over
flagging every sprint (95% CI [+0.006, +0.094] and [+0.049, +0.148], McNemar *p* < 0.001); held-out
sprint-end F1 95% CI [0.610, 0.814]. A simple open-work-share baseline ranks as well (AUC 0.802 /
0.881) — the projection's value is the early, evidence-carrying warning, not better ranking.

**Synthetic correctness** (180 generated projects with a known planted problem): precision, recall and
F1 **1.00 for all six risk types**, and each detector changes verdict exactly at its documented
threshold (overdue ratio between 0.08 and 0.10; silent ratio between 0.2 and 0.3; workload skew
across 1.50).

### Recommendation

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Every recommendation is grounded in an actual finding | 4,363 / 4,363 |
| Every risk at *medium* or worse gets a recommendation | 4,363 / 4,363 |
| Output valid; no error output | 1,974 / 1,974 |

Coverage by risk type: delay 1,743, workload 1,808, silent members 779, dependency 33. **Knowledge
concentration and coordination never reached *medium* on any real sprint** — the known limit that
those signals rarely appear inside one sprint's window.

**Suggested reassignments, applied.** For every workload recommendation, each suggested move is applied
to the sprint and the risk recomputed:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Workload recommendations | 1,808 — **1,524 (84%) come with moves**; in 284 no move could help |
| The "before" figure matches the board | 1,524 / 1,524 |
| Every move is valid (the task belongs to the person it moves from; the receiver is on the team) | 1,524 / 1,524 |
| No single move raises the heaviest load | 1,524 / 1,524 |
| **Predicted heaviest load after the moves = actual** | **1,524 / 1,524** |
| **Predicted severity after the moves = actual** | **1,524 / 1,524** |
| Severity actually moves down at least one level | **943 / 1,524 (62%)** |
| Reduction in the heaviest load | median **6** points, mean 9.5 |

Of the 581 that did not change level, 519 were *critical* and stayed *critical*: teams so uneven that
the planner's three moves cannot bring them down a band. The prediction still told the user so in
advance. This validates the fix inside the model; whether real teams would follow it is not measured.

### The language-model layer (optional)

| Check | Result | Re-measured? |
|---|---|---|
| Fabricated citations stripped before reaching the user | 200 / 200 | yes |
| No call without a real key (placeholder included) | 0 of 8,883 attempts | yes |
| Agreement between the model's verdict and the deterministic one | Cohen's κ 0.95 (n = 37) | no — needs a paid key |
| Output validity | 41.1% end-to-end; 54–95% for the model itself | no — needs a paid key |
| Graph pipeline vs. sending the whole project | F1 1.000 vs 0.947 (n = 36, not significant) | no — needs a paid key |

## 2. Efficiency

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Prompt growth while the project grows 154× (13 → 2,003 tasks) | **1.47×** (266 → 390 tokens) |
| Naive whole-project prompt at 2,003 tasks | 200,916 tokens → **515× more** than the graph prompt |
| Graph build + all six risks, 203-task project | median 4.7 ms |

The naive prompt is larger than when first published (189,834 tokens, 487×) because tasks and sprints
gained two fields since; the graph prompt is unchanged. The published 487× is the conservative figure.

## 3. Product features

**Tests.** Backend **109** (SQLite locally; SQLite and PostgreSQL 16 in CI), AI service **85**, frontend
**63** plus a clean type check. The demo replay (`check_demo`) holds **14 / 14** claims.

**Roles** ([`test_permission_matrix.py`](backend/app/tests/test_permission_matrix.py)). The permission
each endpoint requires is read off the code, then every protected endpoint (37 route/method pairs) is
called as each of the five roles: **185 / 185** behave exactly as the policy says. A second check fails
the build if any data-changing endpoint is added without a role check.

**Code coverage** — share of statements the test suites execute, excluding the tests themselves
(`pytest-cov`; the backend measured with greenlet tracing, without which SQLAlchemy's async layer hides
code after the first database call and the figure reads 7 points too low):

| Area | Covered |
|---|---|
| Backend code the MVP uses (API routes, models, schemas, services) | **74%** |
| … of which task / project / auth routes | 85% / 84% / 89% |
| Backend code outside the MVP (meetings, admin, background jobs) | 18% |
| AI service, all | **81%** |
| … of which the knowledge graph and metrics | 93% |
| Frontend, all source files (`npm run test:coverage`) | **24%** |
| … analysis panel / hooks / API client and utilities / project settings page | 89% / 89% / 81% / 89% |
| … other pages, task board components, team panel | 0–26%: exercised by the demo replay and by hand, not by unit tests |

**Response times** — end to end over HTTP against the running stack with the real Mesos sprint (30
tasks, 13 people), SQLite, no LLM key, one Windows laptop; 15 timed requests each after 2 warm-ups:

| Feature | Median | 95th percentile |
|---|---|---|
| Sign in | 390 ms | 400 ms |
| Workspace | 10 ms | 11 ms |
| Project | 8 ms | 10 ms |
| Task board (30 tasks) | 14 ms | 15 ms |
| Dependencies / sprints / team | 10 / 11 / 14 ms | 12 / 14 / 17 ms |
| Dashboard | 12 ms | 16 ms |
| Task discussion | 11 ms | 13 ms |
| Create / edit / move / delete a task | 25 / 22 / 22 / 23 ms | 29 / 25 / 25 / 26 ms |
| **Run analysis (backend + AI service)** | **715 ms** | **754 ms** |
| Analysis history | 24 ms | 42 ms |

Sign-in is slow by design: password hashing (bcrypt) is deliberately expensive. Of the analysis time,
the AI pipeline itself takes under 50 ms; the rest is the backend loading the project, calling the AI
service and saving the result.

**Many people at once** ([`load_test.py`](backend/app/scripts/load_test.py), quick levels; same laptop,
SQLite, one server process per service, the load generator on the same machine, so these are a floor).
Each virtual user repeats a session mix of the board, dashboard, project, team, sprints,
dependencies, a discussion, and a create-move-delete on a task, with no pause between requests:

| Load | Before the fixes below | After |
|---|---|---|
| 1 user | 57 req/s · median 15 ms | 57 req/s · median 15 ms |
| 10 users | 59 req/s · p95 345 ms | 77 req/s · p95 212 ms |
| 25 users | 70 req/s · p99 2.0 s | 74 req/s · p99 0.7 s |
| 50 users | 60 req/s · p99 7.1 s · **3 failed** | 78 req/s · p99 1.4 s · 0 failed |
| 5 analyses at once | median 1.9 s | median 2.2 s |
| 25 people signing in at once | all done in 9.8 s · **4 failed** | all done in 1.9 s · 0 failed |

The server peaks near 75 requests a second on SQLite; beyond that more users means longer waits,
not failures. With a person making a request every few seconds, that is on the order of a few hundred
people working at once on this laptop. CI now runs the same quick test on SQLite and PostgreSQL on
every push and fails on any failed request.

## 4. Published results, re-run

| Evaluation | Re-run result |
|---|---|
| TAWOS, all 987 sprints | identical to the published file |
| TAWOS, 270 held-out sprints | identical |
| Held-out bootstrap confidence interval | identical |
| Mid-sprint checkpoints and paired tests | identical |
| Synthetic detection | **had broken** — F1 1.00 → 0.92; identical again after the fix below |
| Threshold boundaries | exact again after the same fix |
| Token scaling | graph side identical; naive baseline larger (see §2) |

## 5. Defects this validation found — all fixed

| Defect | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| The admin deactivation endpoint had **no role check** | Any signed-in member, even a viewer, could deactivate any account — the owner's included | Admin area limited to admins and owners |
| Member removal and deactivation had **no rank check** | An admin could remove or lock out the owner | Nobody acts on someone above them, or on themselves |
| Member removal **always crashed** | It set a required field to empty | Removal now revokes roles and project memberships and disables the account |
| A disabled account kept working until its token expired | Up to 30 minutes of continued changes | Every permission check refuses a disabled account |
| Meeting and organizational-memory endpoints had **no role check** | A viewer could create and change data | Checked against the permissions the policy already defined |
| The admin statistics endpoint **always crashed** | Used a name before importing it | Imports fixed |
| The synthetic evaluation used the **wall clock** | A month after publication, healthy scenarios' due dates had passed and read as overdue: F1 silently fell to 0.92 | Scenarios judged at their own fixed clock; the result is now a CI test |

None of these was in a path the web app uses, which is why no test or demo had exercised them; all
were reachable through the deployed API. Each now has a regression test.

The load test found three more, all fixed:

| Defect | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Password hashing ran **on the server's event loop** | Every sign-in (~0.3 s of bcrypt) froze all other requests; 25 at once took 9.8 s and 4 failed | Hashing runs on a worker thread |
| Every SQL statement was **logged whenever `DEBUG` was on** — the default, Docker Compose included | Slower requests everywhere | Statement logging is its own setting, `SQL_ECHO`, off by default |
| SQLite gave up on a busy write lock after 5 s | Under 50 users, some task writes failed with "database is locked" | Write-ahead logging, and a 30 s wait for the lock |

## 6. What this validation does not show

- **Whether the explanations help people** — there is no human evaluation yet. The study is ready
  to run: protocol, forms, two real sprints, setup script, answer key and analysis script are in
  [`docs/user-study/`](docs/user-study/PROTOCOL.md); it needs 8–12 participants.
- **Knowledge and coordination risk on real data** — they never reach *medium* on a real sprint.
- **The language-model layer's current behaviour** — its three results above are from the published
  runs; re-measuring needs a paid key.
- **Whether real teams would follow the suggested moves** — only that the moves do what they predict.
- **Anything about a deployed instance.** Everything here was measured locally and in CI. The
  production overlay (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) and its hardening — built frontend, closed
  database and AI service, TLS, sign-in rate limit — are covered by their own tests and by the
  Docker job in CI, but no public instance has been run or attacked.
- **Whether GitHub sync helps a real team.** It landed after this validation: it is covered by
  its own 20 tests, but no real repository's history has been replayed through it, and none of the
  TAWOS results above involve it.
- **Production-scale performance** — the load test ran on one laptop on SQLite; CI repeats it on
  PostgreSQL on a shared runner, but nothing has been measured on production hardware.

The charts and a per-agent completeness matrix are in
[`PHASE1_PERFORMANCE_METRICS.pdf`](PHASE1_PERFORMANCE_METRICS.pdf).
