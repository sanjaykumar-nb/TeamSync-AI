# TeamSync AI

[![CI](https://github.com/sanjaykumar-nb/FYP1/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sanjaykumar-nb/FYP1/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Explainable, Graph-Grounded Multi-Agent Project Intelligence**

TeamSync AI is a Kanban project-management platform with an AI layer that detects six kinds of
team coordination risk, explains each with mechanically verifiable evidence, and recommends
corrective actions — without ever handing your project's raw data to a language model.

> **The core idea:** don't ask an LLM to *find* risk in a pile of project data. Compute risk
> deterministically from a knowledge graph, then let the LLM only *narrate* one already-computed
> finding from a small, bounded slice of that graph. The LLM never sees or judges the raw
> dataset — it only explains an already-verified fact.

This yields two measured, headline properties: prompt cost that stays flat as the project grows
instead of scaling with it (**487× cheaper** than naive prompting at 2,000+ tasks), and evidence
citations that are mechanically checked rather than merely requested (**200/200** fabricated
references caught and stripped). A held-out real-world evaluation shows the zero-parameter graph
rule **beating a tuned machine-learning model** on unseen projects.

## The Problem

Teams using conventional project-management tools (Jira, Linear, Asana, Monday.com) run into four
compounding failures:

1. **Risk is detected late.** Tools show current state, not risk trajectory. A silently
   overloaded engineer or a slipping critical-path task becomes visible only after the damage.
2. **Warnings are opaque.** When a tool flags something "at risk," it rarely shows *which
   evidence* produced that verdict, so a manager can neither act on it nor challenge it.
3. **Signals are siloed.** No single view reveals a cross-cutting risk such as "the only person
   who understands this component is also unresponsive and on the critical path."
4. **Naive AI fixes create new problems.** Feeding raw project data to an LLM is expensive (cost
   scales with project size), non-deterministic (same input, different verdicts), and produces
   justifications nobody can verify.

## The Approach

1. Compile project state into a **typed knowledge graph** (people, tasks, milestones,
   dependencies, comments) — from data the product already stores, no new collection required.
2. Compute all six risks as **deterministic graph algorithms** — zero LLM tokens, zero randomness.
3. For each detected anomaly, extract a small **witness subgraph** containing only the relevant nodes.
4. Give the LLM **only that subgraph** and ask it to *narrate* — never to decide.
5. **Mechanically verify** every citation against the subgraph; discard anything unresolvable.
6. Every agent has a **rule-based fallback** with an identical schema, so the whole pipeline works
   with no LLM configured at all — a genuine offline/zero-cost demo mode, not a degraded one.

| Risk type | How it's detected |
|---|---|
| Dependency / critical path | Longest path through the task-dependency DAG |
| Dependency concentration | Betweenness centrality of task nodes |
| Knowledge / single point of failure | Articulation points in the person↔component graph |
| Workload imbalance | Weighted degree over story-point assignments |
| Coordination gaps | Community structure over the collaboration graph |
| Silent members | Comment activity ÷ assignment load |

## Architecture

**Three independently deployable services**, connected as follows:

![Service topology](docs/images/architecture-topology.svg)

The part that matters is the **analysis pipeline** inside the AI service — this is the core
contribution:

![Graph-grounded agent prompting](docs/images/architecture-pipeline.svg)

Steps A–D and the risk *scores* involve **no LLM call at all**. Only the narration step touches
the model, and only on a bounded slice of the graph — which is what makes prompt cost scale with
the number of anomalies found, not with how large the project is.

| Service | Technology | Port | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind, TypeScript | 3000 | UI, Kanban board, dashboards, WebSocket client |
| **Core API** | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async), Pydantic v2 | 8000 | Auth, CRUD, multi-tenancy, persistence |
| **AI Service** | FastAPI, NetworkX, Groq client | 8001 | Knowledge-graph build, risk metrics, agent pipeline |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (SQLite for tests/local) | 5432 | System of record |
| Cache / queue | Redis 7 + Celery | 6379 | Caching, background tasks |

## Key Results

Every number below is measured and reproducible — see [Reproducing the Evaluation](#datasets--reproducing-the-evaluation).

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Prompt-token growth vs. project-size growth | **1.47× tokens for a 154× larger project** |
| Prompt-token reduction vs. naive full-dataset prompting | **99.8% (487×)** at 2,003 tasks |
| Mid-sprint warning, held-out (22 unseen projects) | **AUC 0.792 halfway through a sprint, 0.874 at three-quarters** |
| Mid-sprint F1 vs. flagging every sprint | **+0.050** halfway, **+0.099** at three-quarters (both *p* < 0.001) |
| Held-out sprint-end F1 (TAWOS, 22 unseen projects) | **0.712** recall-first, where a tuned model's cross-validated 0.816 fell to 0.593 |
| Detection accuracy: graph vs. naive prompting (controlled ablation) | **1.000 vs 0.947** — no accuracy lost (n = 36, not significant) |
| Evidence-grounding enforcement | **200/200** fabricated citations stripped |
| LLM-narration vs. deterministic-verdict agreement (Cohen's κ) | **0.95** |
| Deterministic pipeline latency (p50, 203 tasks) | **~11 ms** |

![Token scaling](docs/images/eval-token-scaling.svg)

Three separate attempts to improve accuracy with more sophisticated methods (threshold tuning,
individualized due-date estimation, a trained logistic-regression composite score) **all failed
or backfired** on held-out data — reported prominently because it's what makes the headline claim
credible rather than cherry-picked. The honest reading of the sprint-end comparison is that the
tuned model's advantage did not survive unseen projects, not that the simple rule is more accurate:
a paired test cannot separate the two (*p* = 0.78). Both beat flagging every sprint. Full details, all metrics, and the independent re-audit of
every number: [IEEE_PAPER_REPORT.md](IEEE_PAPER_REPORT.md).

## Features

**Product**
- Organization-based multi-tenancy with JWT auth and refresh rotation
- Role-based permissions (owner, admin, project manager, developer, viewer) checked on every
  change; nobody can grant a role above their own
- Projects with sprints (start and end dates, work done against time elapsed), health/risk scores,
  and a drag-and-drop Kanban board that filters by sprint
- Task components (the code area a task touches), which drive the knowledge-concentration and
  coordination risks
- Task dependencies (with real multi-hop cycle detection), subtasks, comments
- GitHub sync: commits and pull requests that name a task move it along and are linked to it
  as evidence (see "Tracking work from GitHub" below)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

**AI intelligence layer**
- Five active specialist agents (Planning, Progress, Workload, Risk, Recommendation)
- Deterministic, zero-token risk scoring with optional LLM narration on top
- Early warning: a burn-down projection flags sprints falling behind pace before their deadline
  (AUC 0.79 halfway through a sprint on 22 held-out real projects)
- Rule-based fallback for every agent — fully functional with no API key configured
- Mechanically enforced evidence grounding on every recommendation
- Full audit trail: every analysis run persists its specialist outputs, risk scores, and the
  exact witness subgraph used to produce them

**Deliberately deferred** (documented scope, not a hidden gap): Meeting Intelligence and
Communication Intelligence (no transcript/chat data source exists in the product yet), a
multi-agent Review Trio, Organizational Memory/RAG, per-project roles, persistent graph storage.

## Getting Started

### Option A — Docker (recommended, matches production topology)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjaykumar-nb/FYP1.git
cd FYP1
cp .env.example .env          # GROQ_API_KEY is optional — the app is fully functional without one
make up                       # Postgres, Redis, the backend, the AI service and the frontend
make db-seed                  # 1 org, 6 demo users, 3 projects, 45 tasks with real dependency/workload risk
```

The backend creates its tables on startup, so there is no migration step. Scheduled background
jobs are not part of the demo and stay off unless you ask for them:
`docker compose --profile scheduled up -d`.


- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 — log in as `pm@demo.com` / `password123`
- Core API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- AI service docs: http://localhost:8001/docs

### Option B — Without Docker

Each service can run standalone against SQLite; useful for quick local development or if Docker
isn't available.

```bash
# 1. AI service
cd ai-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001

# 2. Core backend (new terminal)
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///./dev.db"
export JWT_SECRET="dev-secret-key-at-least-32-characters-long"
python -m app.scripts.seed              # optional but recommended — populates demo data
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000

# 3. Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 and log in with `pm@demo.com` / `password123` (or register a
new account). Open a project → **AI Insights** tab → **Run Analysis**.

### Deploying it

For a real deployment — built frontend, TLS, closed database, no reload — use the production
overlay and [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

### Tracking work from GitHub

Set a repository in **Project settings → GitHub repository** (`owner/name`), then press
**Sync with GitHub**. It reads the last 100 commits and pull requests and matches them to tasks by
what the author wrote:

- the task's reference — eight characters shown on the task's **GitHub** tab, e.g. a branch named
  `fix/a1b2c3d4-retry-loop`;
- or a key like `MESOS-8383` when the task's title starts with one (sprints imported from Jira do).

A commit starts a task, an open pull request sends it to review, a merged one finishes it. Tasks
never move backwards, nothing is written to GitHub, and every change links the commit or pull
request behind it. Public repositories need no credentials; `GITHUB_TOKEN` (a read-only token)
raises the rate limit and reaches private ones. People can record their handle in **Profile →
GitHub username**.

For **instant updates** instead of pressing Sync, press **Set up a webhook** in the same place. It
shows the payload URL, the content type and a secret, once — paste them into the repository's
*Settings → Webhooks*, and select the **push** and **pull request** events. GitHub then calls the
project the moment someone pushes or opens a pull request. Every call must carry a signature made
with that secret, and one that does not is refused without being read. GitHub has to reach the URL,
so a laptop on localhost needs a tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000`).

### See it on a real sprint

The seed data above is invented. To watch the system analyse **real project history** — sprint 74
of Apache Mesos from the TAWOS dataset, loaded through the app's own API — run this with the backend
and AI service up:

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.scripts.import_real_sprint app/scripts/fixtures/mesos_sprint_74.json
```

It prints a login for the imported project. On the board you can open the sprint's real blocking
links and discussions, and **AI Insights** shows every finding with the exact issues and people it
rests on. The workload recommendation comes with reassignments you can apply in one click; run the
analysis again and the scores that changed are marked. Add `--at 0.5` to replay the sprint as it stood
halfway through: nothing is overdue yet, and AI Insights already warns that it is behind pace. The
full walkthrough, including what is real and what the replay derives, is in [DEMO.md](DEMO.md).

## Running Tests

```bash
make test               # everything
make test-backend       # backend: 108 tests
make test-ai            # AI service: 85 tests
make test-frontend      # frontend: 63 tests (vitest)
```

Or per-service, without Docker:

```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest -q
cd ai-service && python -m pytest -q -m "not deferred"
cd frontend && npm run type-check && npm run test:ci
```

`deferred` marks the five tests for meeting and communication intelligence. Those features have no
data source in the product yet, so their tests stay in the tree rather than being deleted, and two
of them currently fail — see [Known Limitations](#known-limitations).

Every push and pull request runs ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)):

- all three suites and the frontend type check, with the backend suite on **both SQLite and
  PostgreSQL 16** (set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to run it against a PostgreSQL of your own);
- `python -m app.scripts.check_demo` against both services on each database — it replays the real
  Mesos sprint and fails if the demo no longer shows any number [the demo script](docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md)
  quotes;
- `docker compose up --build`, then the same demo check against the running stack.

## Datasets & Reproducing the Evaluation

The real-world evaluation uses **TAWOS** (Tawosi, Al-Subaihin, Moussa & Sarro, MSR 2022,
Apache 2.0) — 458,232 real Jira issues across 39 open-source projects. It is not redistributed in
this repository (4.3 GB); see `ai-service/eval/datasets/` for the loader and required citation.

Every number in this README and in `IEEE_PAPER_REPORT.md` is reproducible from committed scripts:

```bash
cd ai-service
python -m eval.run_eval                     # synthetic detection, token scaling, latency, grounding
python -m eval.boundary_eval                 # threshold-boundary sensitivity
python -m eval.datasets.tawos_load           # TAWOS .sql -> SQLite (needs the raw dump, ~4.3GB)
python -m eval.datasets.tawos_split          # fixed project-level train/held-out split
python -m eval.datasets.tawos_score          # all-987-sprint result
python -m eval.datasets.tawos_holdout_eval   # the one-shot held-out headline number
python -m eval.ablation_naive_vs_graph       # graph vs. naive prompting, controlled comparison
python -m eval.live_llm_eval                 # schema validity + LLM-vs-deterministic agreement
python -m eval.make_figures                  # regenerate every figure in docs/images/ (offline)
```

## Known Limitations

Stated explicitly rather than left implicit:

- **Roles are organization-wide.** Every change is checked against the caller's role, but a role
  applies to all projects in the organization; per-project roles are not implemented.
- **Only one of six risk types has real-world (non-synthetic) validation** — delay prediction,
  validated on TAWOS. The other five are validated against deterministic synthetic scenarios,
  which check implementation correctness, not real-world generalization.
- **The TAWOS delay label is a proxy** (the dataset has no due-date field), not a canonical
  "past due date" definition.
- **Meeting Intelligence and Communication Intelligence are unimplemented** — no transcript or
  chat/email data source exists in the product yet. A documented scoping decision.
- **Single LLM provider** (Groq) — cross-provider robustness is untested.

The full, unabridged threats-to-validity list (ten items) is in
[IEEE_PAPER_REPORT.md § Limitations](IEEE_PAPER_REPORT.md#9-limitations-and-threats-to-validity).

## Troubleshooting

- **Groq returns `model_not_found`.** Groq periodically deprecates models; `AI_MODEL` in
  `.env.example` reflects what worked at time of writing (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`). Check available
  models with `curl https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY"`
  and update `AI_MODEL` accordingly — or leave `GROQ_API_KEY` unset entirely; every agent has a
  full deterministic fallback and the app remains completely functional without an LLM.
- **`make up` fails / Docker not installed.** Use [Option B](#option-b--without-docker) — every
  service runs standalone against SQLite with no other dependency.
- **Login returns 422.** The login endpoint expects form-encoded credentials
  (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`), not JSON — this is intentional (see
  `backend/app/api/v1/auth.py`).

## Roadmap

- Meeting Intelligence (transcript ingestion, evaluated against the AMI Meeting Corpus)
- Communication Intelligence (chat/email ingestion, evaluated against the Enron Email Corpus)
- Bootstrapped confidence intervals on the held-out evaluation
- A human evaluation of explanation quality/usefulness
- Per-project roles
