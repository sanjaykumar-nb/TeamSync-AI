## 1. Problem Statement & Motivation

Software teams using conventional project-management tools (Jira, Linear, Asana, Monday.com)
suffer from four compounding failures:

1. **Late detection.** Coordination breakdowns — a single point of failure, a silently
   overloaded engineer, a critical-path task slipping — are visible only after they have already
   caused a delay. Tools show current state, not risk trajectory.
2. **Opacity.** When a tool *does* surface a warning ("at risk"), it rarely explains which
   evidence produced that verdict, so a project manager cannot act on it or challenge it.
3. **Data silos.** Task status, meeting outcomes, and communication patterns live in disconnected
   systems (or disconnected views of the same system), so no one signal alone reveals a
   cross-cutting risk like "the one person who understands this component hasn't been
   responded to in 9 days and is also the sole assignee on the critical path."
4. **Lost institutional memory.** Decisions, blockers, and rationale discussed in meetings or
   chat evaporate; the same questions get re-litigated project after project.

**Objectives set for this project:**

- Build a modular multi-agent architecture that decomposes "project intelligence" into
  specialist analyses that can run, fail, and be explained independently.
- Make explainability a structural property, not an afterthought — every claim the system makes
  must be traceable to a concrete, checkable piece of evidence.
- Compute a unified, actionable intelligence signal (risk score, tier, prioritized
  recommendations) rather than a wall of disconnected metrics.
- Make it production-grade, not a notebook demo: multi-tenant, real-time, horizontally
  extensible, and — critically — **cheap and reliable enough to run on every project change**,
  not just as an occasional expensive report.

That last point is what led to the project's central technical contribution, described in §5.

## 2. What the System Is

TeamSync AI is a **Kanban-style project management application** (projects, tasks, milestones,
dependencies, comments, org-based multi-tenancy) instrumented with an **AI analysis pipeline**
that periodically or on-demand computes six categories of coordination risk, explains them with
cited evidence, and proposes prioritized corrective actions.

Architecturally it is a **three-service system**: a Next.js frontend, a FastAPI core backend
(auth, CRUD, persistence, real-time), and a separate FastAPI AI service that hosts the
multi-agent pipeline and talks to an LLM (Groq/Llama) with a deterministic rule-based fallback
for every agent.

What distinguishes it from "wrap an LLM around your database and ask it to find problems" is the
architectural choice described next.

## 3. Core Novelty & Contributions

### 3.1 Graph-Grounded Agent Prompting (the headline contribution)

> Project state is compiled into a typed, in-memory **knowledge graph**. The six coordination-risk
> types are computed as **deterministic graph invariants** — critical-path length, articulation
> points, weighted degree, community structure — not inferred by a language model. The LLM is
> shown only a single computed finding plus its **minimal witness subgraph** (a bounded k-hop
> neighborhood around the anomaly) and is required to cite node ids drawn from that subgraph.
> Citations that don't resolve to a real node in the witness set are mechanically stripped.

This single design decision produces two independently measurable properties, both of which are
the strongest empirical claims this project can make (§12.3):

- **Prompt cost is O(number of anomalies), not O(project size).** Measured: 266 → 390 tokens for
  a 154× increase in project size (13 → 2,003 tasks) — a **1.47×** growth for a **154×** size
  increase. Against the naive "stringify everything into the prompt" baseline this project started
  with, that is a **99.8% (487×) token reduction** at 2,003 tasks.
- **Hallucinated evidence becomes mechanically detectable, not merely improbable.** A grounding
  check (`drop_ungrounded()`) strips any `evidence.reference_id` not present in the witness
  subgraph's node-id set. Measured: 200/200 synthetically fabricated references correctly
  stripped.

### 3.2 Deterministic-first risk computation

All six risk types (dependency, workload, knowledge/SPOF, coordination, silent-member, delay) are
computed by graph algorithms with zero LLM tokens and zero stochasticity — the LLM's only job is
to *narrate* an already-computed finding, not decide whether it exists. This makes the numeric
core reproducible (identical input → identical risk scores, every time) and testable with
ordinary unit tests, which a pure-LLM risk detector cannot offer.

### 3.3 Evidence-grounded explainability as an enforced invariant, not a prompt instruction

Most "explainable AI" systems ask the LLM nicely to cite sources. This system checks the citation
against a concrete, bounded set of valid ids and discards anything that doesn't match — turning
"the model was asked to cite evidence" into "every surviving citation is verifiably real."

### 3.4 Fully schema-typed multi-agent orchestration with per-agent deterministic fallback

Every agent (five specialists in the MVP, extendable to eleven) shares one structured output
contract (`AgentOutput`: summary, risk_level, confidence, signals, evidence, recommendations,
next_action, metadata) enforced server-side via JSON-schema response formatting, and every agent
has an independent rule-based fallback with the *identical* schema, so a failed or absent LLM
call degrades gracefully rather than crashing the pipeline.

### 3.5 A real-world, honestly reported evaluation, including negative results

Rather than reporting only favorable synthetic numbers, the evaluation includes a project-level
held-out test against a public 458K-issue Jira dataset (§12.4) and three documented attempts to
improve accuracy that **failed or backfired** (§12.5) — reported because a negative result that
rules out added complexity is itself a finding, and because it is what makes the "simple,
zero-parameter graph rule matches a tuned learned model on unseen data" claim credible rather than
cherry-picked. The evaluation also runs at pre-registered mid-sprint checkpoints (§12.4), which is
where a delay warning has to arrive to be worth anything.

### 4.2 Request flow for an analysis

```
User clicks "Run Analysis"
  → Core API: POST /api/v1/analyze
      → SnapshotBuilder reads Postgres → ProjectSnapshot (dict shape)
      → AI Service: POST /analyze  { snapshot }
          → GraphBuilder.build(snapshot)      → ProjectGraph (NetworkX MultiDiGraph)
          → GraphMetrics(now=...).compute()   → deterministic findings (0 LLM tokens)

          → CoordinatorAgent
              → Planning / Progress / Workload agents (parallel, graph-grounded)
              → Risk agent (aggregates the six graph-computed scores)
              → Recommendation agent (evidence-linked prioritized actions)
          → drop_ungrounded()                 → strip any unverifiable citation
      ← CoordinatorOutput (typed, schema-validated)
  → persists AgentRun row (specialist outputs, risk scores, witness subgraph)
  ← real AgentRun id
Frontend: GET /api/v1/analytics/projects/{id}/agent-runs → risk + recommendation panel
```

### 4.3 Deployment topology

- **Local/dev:** Docker Compose — postgres, redis, backend, ai-service, celery-worker,
  celery-beat, frontend, one command (`make up`).
- **Production-oriented:** Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/` with health checks, resource limits,
  secrets, and Alembic migrations wired into CI/CD.
- **Config surface:** `JWT_SECRET`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL`, `AI_TEMPERATURE`,
  `AI_MAX_TOKENS`, `AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` — no secret defaults are trusted outside
  `ENVIRONMENT=development`.

## 5. Knowledge Graph Core (the central contribution)

### 5.1 Why a graph, specifically

Every one of the six claimed risk types is, on inspection, literally a graph property computable
without any inference step:

| Risk type | Graph computation | Library primitive |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency / critical path | Longest path through the `BLOCKS` DAG | `dag_longest_path` |
| Dependency concentration | Betweenness centrality of task nodes | `betweenness_centrality` |
| Knowledge / SPOF | Articulation points in the Person↔Component projection | `articulation_points` |
| Workload | Weighted degree of `Person` over `ASSIGNED_TO` (weight = story points) | `degree(weight='points')` |
| Coordination | Community structure over the collaboration projection | `louvain_communities` |
| Silent member | `COMMENTED_ON` degree ÷ `ASSIGNED_TO` degree | degree ratio |
| Delay | Critical-path tasks still open past their due date | path filter |

Treating these as graph invariants instead of LLM judgment calls buys determinism, unit-testability,
and — because graph algorithms are cheap — near-zero compute cost per analysis (§12.3).

**A free correctness bug fix fell out of this:** the pre-existing dependency-creation endpoint only
checked for direct self-loops (`add_dependency`, `backend/app/api/v1/tasks.py`), so a three-hop
cycle A→B→C→A was creatable through the API. `nx.simple_cycles` over the `BLOCKS` edge type gives
real cycle detection for free once the graph exists.

### 5.2 Graph schema

**Nodes:** `Person`, `Task`, `Milestone`, `Project`, `Component` (a `Meeting`/`Decision` node type
is designed but deferred — see §16).

**Edges**, all derived from existing relational tables — no new data collection required:

| Edge | Source table/field |
|---|---|
| `Person -[ASSIGNED_TO {points}]-> Task` | `Task.assignee_id`, `Task.story_points` |
| `Person -[REPORTED]-> Task` | `Task.reporter_id` |
| `Task -[BLOCKS]-> Task` | `TaskDependency` |
| `Task -[SUBTASK_OF]-> Task` | `Task.parent_task_id` |
| `Task -[PART_OF]-> Milestone` | `Task.milestone_id` |
| `Person -[COMMENTED_ON]-> Task` | `TaskComment` |
| `Person -[MEMBER_OF]-> Project` | `ProjectMember` |
| `Task -[TOUCHES]-> Component` | derived (milestone as a component proxy in MVP) |
| `Person -[KNOWS {depth}]-> Component` | derived: `ASSIGNED_TO` ∘ `TOUCHES` |

Implementation: `ai-service/app/graph/builder.py` (`GraphBuilder`, `ProjectGraph`, `node_id()`),
compiling a `ProjectSnapshot` into an in-memory NetworkX `MultiDiGraph` per analysis.
**Storage decision:** NetworkX in-memory, rebuilt per analysis — already a transitive dependency,
pure Python, zero new infrastructure, and every needed algorithm ships with it. At the scale of a
few hundred to a few thousand tasks per project, a persistent graph database earns nothing; the
`GraphBuilder` interface is kept swappable so a Neo4j/Cypher backend is a contained future change,
not a rewrite.

### 5.3 Witness subgraph selection — the token-efficiency mechanism

`SubgraphSelector` (`ai-service/app/graph/subgraph.py`) extracts a bounded k-hop (k=1)
neighborhood around each anomalous node, capped at `MAX_NEIGHBORS_PER_SEED = 8` and
`MAX_WITNESS_NODES = 60`. This is what makes prompt cost scale with *anomaly count*, not *project
size* — a healthy 2,000-task project with a handful of anomalies produces almost the same prompt
size as a 13-task project with the same anomaly count (measured 1.47× vs. 154× size growth,
§12.3).

*Bug caught and fixed during development:* the first implementation expanded **all** neighbors of
a seed node with no cap, so witness-subgraph size still grew with project size (4.31× growth for
50→2,000 tasks). Adding the per-seed neighbor cap brought growth down to 1.007×.

### 5.4 Evidence grounding — the anti-hallucination mechanism

`ai-service/app/graph/grounding.py`: `drop_ungrounded()` computes the set of valid node ids from
the witness subgraph and strips any `evidence.reference_id` in an agent's output that isn't in
that set; `check_grounding()` reports the count. This turns "the LLM was told not to hallucinate
citations" into a checked invariant enforced after generation, independent of prompt compliance.

*Bug caught and fixed:* the original semantics treated an *empty* findings list the same as *no*
filter (`if finding_ids:` — falsy on `[]`), silently allowing everything through when nothing
should have been grounded. Fixed to `if finding_ids is not None:` so "grounded against nothing"
correctly means "nothing survives."

---

## 6. Multi-Agent Pipeline

### 6.1 Orchestration pattern

**Coordinator → N specialists (parallel) → Risk aggregator → Recommendation generator →
(optional) Review Trio.**

```python
CoordinatorAgent.run():
    graph = GraphBuilder().build(snapshot)
    analysis = GraphMetrics(now=...).compute(graph)          # 0 tokens, deterministic
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        planning_agent.run(build_planning_input(graph, analysis)),
        progress_agent.run(build_progress_input(graph, analysis)),
        workload_agent.run(build_workload_input(graph, analysis)),
    )                                                          # parallel, per-agent fallback
    risk_output = risk_output_from_graph(analysis)             # aggregates the 6 graph scores
    recs = recommendation_output_from_graph(risk_output, results)
    return CoordinatorOutput(specialist_outputs=..., risk=risk_output, recommendations=recs)
```

### 6.2 Agent roster

| Agent | Input | Output | Risk types informed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planning | Milestones, tasks, capacity, graph metrics | Sprint readiness %, feasibility, capacity gaps | Delay, Dependency |
| Progress | Tasks, velocity history, graph metrics | Velocity trend, completion forecast, stalled work | Delay, Coordination |
| Workload Intelligence | Assignments, story points, graph metrics | Overloaded/underutilized members, SPOFs, dependency concentration | Workload, Dependency |
| Risk Prediction | The six graph-computed scores | Aggregated risk scores + evidence, overall level | All 6 |
| Recommendation | Risk output + specialist outputs (by reference, not full re-dump) | Prioritized, evidence-linked actions | N/A |
| *(deferred)* Meeting Intelligence | Transcript, participants | Decisions, action items, blockers, owners | Coordination, Knowledge |
| *(deferred)* Communication Intelligence | Communication events (14-day window) | Response delays, unanswered questions, participation gaps | Silent Member, Coordination |
| *(deferred)* Review Trio | A proposal/plan | Approve / Approve-with-changes / Request-revision / Reject, per Frontend/Backend/AI-ML domain reviewers | N/A |

The MVP scope deliberately includes only the five agents whose input already exists in the
product (task, milestone, assignment, dependency, comment data). Meeting Intelligence and
Communication Intelligence are architecturally complete but deferred because their input sources
(transcripts, chat/email streams) don't yet exist in the app — a scoping decision, not a
difficulty one (see §16).

### 6.3 Unified output schema

Every agent, LLM-backed or fallback, returns the same typed shape:

```python
AgentOutput:
    summary: str
    risk_level: Literal["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]
    confidence: float            # 0-1
    signals: list[Signal]        # {name, value, weight}
    evidence: list[Evidence]     # {source, reference_id, excerpt, relevance}
    recommendations: list[Recommendation]  # {type, title, description, reasoning, priority, confidence}
    next_action: str
    metadata: dict                # includes a `fallback: bool` flag
```

### 6.4 LLM integration and deterministic fallback

- **LLM:** Groq-hosted Llama (currently `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`), JSON-mode response format,
  server-side schema enforcement (not just prompt instruction), temperature 0.1, bounded retries.
- **Fallback:** every agent has an independent, deterministic, rule-based implementation with the
  *identical* output schema — capacity heuristics, velocity-trend arithmetic, keyword extraction,
  response-time analysis, load-variance computation, risk aggregation, risk→action mapping. If
  `GROQ_API_KEY` is unset, absent, or the call fails, the pipeline degrades to fallback per-agent
  rather than failing the whole run. This is also the **demo guarantee**: the full pipeline
  produces a complete, schema-valid, evidence-grounded output with zero external API calls.

### 6.5 Correctness bugs fixed during development (relevant to a "lessons learned" section)

- **Wrong input type reaching every specialist.** The coordinator originally forwarded its own
  `CoordinatorInput` unchanged to every specialist; each agent read fields (e.g.
  `input_data.milestones`) that only exist on its *own* typed input, outside its `try` block, so
  every single run threw an `AttributeError` that `asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)` quietly
  swallowed into an error stub. **Every specialist failed on every run** until this was fixed by
  building the correct typed input per specialist from graph queries.
- **Risk aggregation ignored its inputs entirely.** Specialist outputs were keyed by *agent name*
  (`planning`, `progress`, `workload`) but looked up by *risk type* (`delay`, `coordination`, …) —
  disjoint key spaces, so risk output was a constant regardless of input. Superseded (not patched)
  by computing risk scores directly from `GraphMetrics`.
- **Subclass fields silently dropped.** `CoordinatorOutput.specialist_outputs` was typed
  `dict[str, AgentOutput]` but fed subclass `model_dump()` dicts; Pydantic coerced everything to
  the base class, discarding fields like `sprint_readiness`. Fixed by retyping to `dict[str,
  dict]`.
- **Fake analysis id.** `POST /analyze` originally returned a hardcoded all-zeros UUID instead of
  a real persisted run. Fixed to create and return a genuine `AgentRun`.
- **Credentials in the URL.** `/auth/login` originally bound `email`/`password` as query
  parameters (FastAPI's default for bare scalar params), leaking passwords into access logs and
  browser history. Fixed with `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` (body-encoded).

---

## 7. Explainability & Trust Mechanisms

1. **Evidence-first schema.** Every signal and every recommendation must carry a `reference_id`
   pointing at concrete source data — never a bare claim.
2. **Mechanical grounding enforcement.** §5.4 — citations outside the witness subgraph are
   stripped, not merely discouraged.
3. **Confidence propagation.** Per-signal confidence rolls up to per-agent confidence, which rolls
   up to the coordinator's overall confidence — a caller can distinguish "low confidence because
   sparse data" from "high confidence, corroborated by the graph."
4. **Deterministic numeric core.** Risk *scores* are graph computations, not LLM guesses —
   identical input always produces identical scores; only the natural-language narration varies.
5. **Fallback transparency.** `metadata.fallback = true` on any output produced without the LLM,
   so downstream consumers (and the evaluation harness) can distinguish LLM-narrated findings from
   rule-based ones.
6. **Raw-response validation.** `validate_output()` is run against the LLM's raw response, not a
   value that has already round-tripped through Pydantic coercion — otherwise the validator is
   structurally incapable of catching a malformed response (a bug caught during development, see
   §6.5-adjacent fixes in the source history).

---

## 8. Data Model

**Core tables:** `organizations`, `users`, `roles`, `user_roles`, `teams`, `team_members`,
`projects`, `project_members`, `milestones`, `tasks`, `task_dependencies`, `task_comments`,
`meetings`, `meeting_participants`, `meeting_action_items`, `meeting_decisions`,
`communication_events`, `risk_scores`, `recommendations`, `agent_runs`, `organization_memory`,
`audit_logs`, `notifications`, `workload_snapshots`.

**Key model semantics:**

- `Project` carries rolling `health_score` / `risk_score`.
- `Task` has a Kanban status workflow: `Backlog → Planned → In Progress → Blocked → Review →
  Done`, plus story points, priority, due date, assignee, and dependency edges.
- `RiskScore` stores one row per risk type (of 6) per analysis, with its evidence payload.
- `AgentRun` persists the full `CoordinatorOutput` — specialist outputs, risk scores,
  recommendations, and the **witness subgraph** used to generate them, so a run is fully
  auditable after the fact.
- `OrganizationMemory` is the (currently stub) surface for cross-project institutional memory /
  RAG — deferred, see §16.

**Indexing strategy:** composite `(org_id, project_id)` indexes for multi-tenant scoping, partial
indexes for status filters, JSONB GIN indexes for evidence/factors/context columns.

**Dialect neutrality:** models use SQLAlchemy 2.0's dialect-neutral `Uuid` type (not
`postgresql.UUID`) so the same models run against SQLite in tests and Postgres in production
without divergent code paths.

- Organizational Memory / RAG (currently a stub).
- Team Intelligence Index — a single weighted 0–100 blend of health/risk/communication/workload/
  memory dimensions (`WEIGHTS = {health:0.25, risk:0.25, comm:0.20, workload:0.15, memory:0.15}`,
  tiers Excellent≥90 / Good≥75 / Fair≥60 / Poor≥40 / Critical<40) — designed but depends on
  components (comm intel, memory) not yet live.
- Full RBAC enforcement, admin panel, audit-log UI, scheduled Celery-driven periodic analysis.
- Persistent graph storage (Neo4j/Cypher) as an alternative to per-analysis in-memory NetworkX.

## 10. Use Cases

These are concrete scenarios the system is designed to surface, each mapped to the specific graph
computation that detects it (§5.1) and the agent that explains it.

1. **Single point of failure (SPOF) surfacing.** One engineer is the sole assignee across every
   task touching a component. The system flags them as an articulation point in the
   Person↔Component projection *before* they go on leave or leave the team — not after a
   milestone stalls with no one able to pick up the work.

2. **Silent overload detection.** A team member's weighted task load (by story points) is
   significantly above their peers', but they haven't raised it — `workload_skew` crosses its
   threshold and the Workload agent surfaces it with the specific tasks driving the imbalance as
   evidence, before burnout or missed deadlines make it visible anyway.

3. **Critical-path slippage early warning.** A task on the longest dependency chain to a milestone
   is overdue or blocked. Because the critical path is computed exactly (not estimated), the
   system can say precisely which downstream tasks and which milestone date are now at risk — not
   just "a task is late."

4. **Silent member detection.** A person assigned significant work has near-zero commenting/
   collaboration activity relative to their assignment load — a proxy for disengagement, blockage,
   or being out of the loop, surfaced before a status meeting has to discover it manually.

5. **Sprint readiness triage.** Before a sprint starts, the Planning agent checks milestone
   feasibility against current capacity and flags gaps — "12 story points assigned to a person who
   has capacity for 6" — rather than discovering the gap mid-sprint.

6. **Dependency-cycle prevention.** The pre-existing task-dependency API allowed creating a
   circular dependency (A blocks B blocks C blocks A) because its validation only checked for
   direct self-loops. The graph's cycle detection catches multi-hop cycles the moment the graph is
   built, which is a correctness guarantee the relational layer alone could not provide.

7. **Progress-forecast and stalled-work detection.** Velocity trend and completion forecast are
   computed from the task graph's actual state, and tasks that have sat with no forward status
   movement are surfaced explicitly as "stalled," not silently rolled into an average.

8. **Auditable, defensible risk reporting to stakeholders.** Because every finding carries a
   citation that mechanically resolves to real project data (§5.4/§7), a PM presenting a risk
   report can answer "why do you say that" by pointing at the exact task/person/dependency the
   system used — a property a free-text LLM summary cannot offer.

9. **Low-cost continuous analysis.** Because prompt cost is O(anomalies) not O(project size)
   (§12.3), the system is cheap enough to re-run on every meaningful project change rather than
   being reserved for a weekly expensive report — turning "risk detection" from a periodic audit
   into a standing property of the tool.

10. **Zero-dependency demo/offline mode.** Because every agent has a schema-identical deterministic
    fallback, the entire pipeline — graph build, risk computation, evidence-grounded
    recommendations — runs and produces a complete, explainable result with no LLM API key at all,
    useful for offline demos, cost-constrained deployments, or LLM-outage resilience.

## 12. Evaluation

All numbers below are reproducible from `ai-service/eval/` (commands in §17). Nothing is
estimated or illustrative — every figure was independently re-verified, including hand-recomputed
confusion-matrix arithmetic, a from-scratch re-run of both scoring scripts (byte-identical
results), independent reimplementation checks of the AUC and Brier computations against
brute-force and known-answer cases, and direct raw-SQL cross-verification of sampled ground-truth
labels bypassing the ORM layer entirely.

### 12.1 Engineering baseline

- **Tests:** backend 108, ai-service 85 (`pytest -m "not deferred"`), frontend 63 (`vitest run`),
  all run in CI on every push.
- **Quality gates:** ruff/mypy (Python), eslint/prettier/tsc (TypeScript).
- **Demo seed:** `make db-seed` → 1 org, 5 users, 3 projects, 50+ tasks.

### 12.2 Synthetic detection correctness (`python -m eval.run_eval`)

180 generated scenarios (90 positive / 90 negative, 30 per risk type) with a deterministically
injected anomaly, so ground truth is known by construction.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Precision / Recall / F1 / Accuracy | 1.00 / 1.00 / 1.00 / 1.00 |
| Stability | identical across 4 further seeds (1,200 additional trials) |

**Interpretation, stated explicitly:** for deterministic threshold code on unambiguous synthetic
inputs, 100% is the *expected* result of implementation correctness — equivalent to "all unit
tests pass," **not** evidence of real-world generalization. It is reported as a correctness check
only. The genuinely falsifiable check is the boundary sweep:

| Signal | Documented threshold | Observed flip point |
|---|---|---|
| `overdue_ratio` | 0.10 | flips at exactly 0.10 |
| `silent_ratio` | 0.30 | 0.20 → 0.30 (exact) |
| `workload_skew` | 1.50 | bracketed 1.429 → 1.522 |

### 12.3 Efficiency and reliability

| Metric | Value | Component |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt tokens, 13 → 2,003 tasks | 266 → 390 (**1.47×** for **154×** project-size growth) | `SubgraphSelector` |
| vs. pre-graph "stringify everything" baseline at 2,003 tasks | 189,834 → 390 tokens (**99.8%**, 487×) | witness-subgraph selection |
| Deterministic pipeline latency (203 tasks, n=50) | p50 4.8–11.0 ms, p95 6.1–13.4 ms | build + metrics + select |
| Evidence-grounding enforcement | 200/200 fabricated references correctly stripped | `grounding.py` |

The latency figures justify running analysis **synchronously** rather than through a background
queue — the deterministic core is fast enough that queueing overhead would dominate.

### 12.4 Real-world evaluation — TAWOS dataset

**Dataset:** TAWOS (Tawosi, Al-Subaihin, Moussa & Sarro, MSR 2022), Apache 2.0 licensed —
458,232 Jira issues, 39 open-source projects, 12 public Jira repositories. Loaded via a
purpose-built mysqldump extended-INSERT parser (character-state-machine, not regex); **0 parse
errors across the full 4.3 GB dump**, with row counts reconciled exactly against published totals
(project=39, user=206,162, sprint=4,594, issue=458,232, issue_link=246,587, comment=1,518,327).

**Task:** sprint-level delay prediction. TAWOS has no `due_date` field, so the label is derived
from available data: a sprint is *delayed* when ≥30% of its issues were unresolved at sprint end.
Eligible sprints (CLOSED, has an end date, ≥15 issues): **987 sprints, 31 projects, 58.8%
positive rate.**

**Point-in-time reconstruction:** since every issue in an archival dataset is long since
resolved, current status cannot be used directly without leaking the future into a retrospective
label. Each task's state is reconstructed *as of sprint end*, and the graph metrics are evaluated
with `now = sprint_end + 1 day`.

**Split discipline:** a fixed, project-level split — 9 projects / 717 sprints for tuning, **22
projects / 270 sprints held out**, zero overlap. Splitting by *project* (not sprint) prevents a
team's Jira conventions from leaking across the boundary. The held-out set was evaluated exactly
once.

#### Result on all 987 sprints (default, untuned parameters)

| | GraphMetrics | Baseline (story-point median) |
|---|---|---|
| Precision | 0.630 | 0.545 |
| Recall | **1.000** | 0.386 |
| F1 | **0.773** | 0.452 |
| Accuracy | 0.655 | 0.450 |
| AUC-ROC | 0.581 | — |

#### Mid-sprint result (270 held-out sprints) — the headline number

Each sprint is rebuilt as it stood at a checkpoint — only issues created by then exist, only those
resolved by then are done — and the system projects the share of scope still unfinished at the
deadline. Checkpoints, prediction and severity cut-offs were fixed before the held-out projects
were touched.

| Checkpoint | Predictor | Precision | Recall | F1 | AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **50%** | Delay risk ≠ low | 0.581 | 0.902 | **0.706** | **0.792** |
| 50% | Flag every sprint | 0.489 | 1.000 | 0.657 | — |
| **75%** | Delay risk ≠ low | 0.623 | 0.962 | **0.756** | **0.874** |
| 75% | Delay risk high or worse | 0.719 | 0.909 | **0.803** | — |
| 75% | Flag every sprint | 0.489 | 1.000 | 0.657 | — |

Paired against flagging every sprint: **+0.050 F1**, 95% CI [+0.006, +0.094] at the halfway point;
**+0.099**, [+0.049, +0.148] at three-quarters; exact McNemar *p* < 0.001 for both. An
open-work-share baseline ranks the same sprints as well (AUC 0.802 and 0.881), so the claim is the
early, explained warning — not better ranking.

#### Sprint-end result (270 sprints, 22 unseen projects) — sanity check

| | F1 | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Deterministic single-signal rule (untuned)** | **0.712** | 0.552 | **1.000** |
| Tuned composite logistic model | 0.593 | 0.620 | 0.568 |

**Reading this result:** the system flags every delayed sprint (recall 1.00) at the cost of
over-flagging roughly half the on-time ones. That recall is structural: after the deadline, a
delayed sprint is one with unfinished work past the due date, which is the condition the rule
tests — so read it as the operating point, not as predictive skill. It is a high-sensitivity
early-warning signal, not a precise classifier, which is the appropriate trade for a project
manager who can dismiss a false alarm cheaply but cannot recover from a missed one. Against the
tuned composite model, a paired test cannot separate the two (exact McNemar *p* = 0.78; bootstrap
F1 difference +0.119, 95% CI [−0.025, +0.291]); against flagging every sprint the rule gains
+0.055, 95% CI [+0.030, +0.080], *p* < 0.001.

### 12.5 Three attempts to improve accuracy — all negative results

Reported in full because a negative result that rules out added complexity is itself a finding,
and it is what makes the headline claim credible rather than cherry-picked.

1. **Threshold sweep** (`tawos_tune.py`) — *provably inert*. Every value from 0.05 to 0.50 gave
   byte-identical output. Cause: with one shared sprint-end due date, `overdue_ratio` is always
   exactly 0.0 or 1.0 for any given sprint, so no threshold strictly between 0 and 1 can change
   any classification.
2. **Individualized per-task due dates** (`tawos_tune2.py`), derived from tuning-set cycle time
   (2.96 days/story-point). This *did* un-collapse the signal (median ratio 0.76, 521/717 sprints
   landing at an intermediate value) but **lowered AUC from 0.581 to 0.531** — story points are too
   noisy a duration proxy to help.
3. **Composite logistic regression** (`tawos_composite.py`) over four live features, 3-fold
   group cross-validation by project. It won decisively on tuning data (**CV F1 0.816, AUC
   0.887**) and **lost on held-out data (F1 0.593)**. Root cause: the largest-magnitude weight
   fell on `idle_member_ratio`, which is *mechanically* coupled to the label (resolved work → zero
   open load → high idle) rather than independently predictive; its calibration is team-specific
   and did not transfer. The AUC collapse from 0.887 to 0.658 is the textbook signature of
   overfitting to project-specific structure rather than a general delay signal.

**Conclusion:** the tuned model's advantage did not cross the project boundary — CV F1 0.816 fell
to 0.593, and a paired test cannot separate it from the zero-parameter rule (*p* = 0.78). Added
complexity bought no measurable accuracy here, and it cost the explanation: the rule's verdict
arrives with the graph nodes behind it.

### 12.6 Threats to validity

- **The label is a proxy**, not ground truth: TAWOS lacks due dates, so "≥30% unresolved at
  sprint end" is a defensible but not canonical definition of a delayed sprint.
- **Structural signals are dead in this specific reconstruction.** SPOF, dependency-cycle, and
  coordination findings are ~0% non-zero here, because issue links in TAWOS span a project's whole
  history and rarely fall inside one sprint window. The real-world result therefore validates
  **one of six** risk types (delay) directly; the other five are validated only synthetically
  (§12.2).
- **`blocked_ratio` never fires** on this dataset — TAWOS's status vocabulary (To Do / In Progress
  / Done) contains no blocked state.
- **AUC is weak by construction** in the sprint-level setup, since all tasks in a reconstructed
  sprint share one deadline.
- **No live-LLM metrics were measured.** Schema-validity rate and fallback-vs-LLM agreement
  (Cohen's κ) require a `GROQ_API_KEY` and are unmeasured; every result above is from the
  deterministic path only.

### 12.7 Independent verification performed on these results

Before including these numbers in a paper, they were re-audited from scratch, not merely
re-quoted:

- Confusion-matrix arithmetic (`tp+fp+fn+tn = n`, and precision/recall/F1/accuracy) recomputed by
  hand for both models — exact match.
- Zero project overlap between tuning and held-out sets confirmed directly (`set() ∩ set() = {}`);
  717 + 270 = 987 partitions cleanly with no leakage, whitespace, or case bugs.
- The composite model's normalization statistics (`means`/`stds`) confirmed fit on tuning-only
  data and frozen (not recomputed) when applied in the held-out script.
- Five randomly sampled held-out sprints' ground-truth labels cross-checked against raw SQL
  directly, bypassing the Python ORM layer entirely — exact match on every sprint.
- `_auc()` verified against perfect separation (1.0), perfect inversion (0.0), tied scores (0.5),
  and a brute-force O(n²) pairwise comparison on 60 random points — exact match to full float
  precision.
- `_brier()` verified against three known-answer edge cases — exact match.
- Both headline scripts (`tawos_score.py`, `tawos_holdout_eval.py`) re-run fresh from a clean
  state — byte-identical to the originally reported numbers (both are fully deterministic).
- Raw SQLite row counts re-queried directly and matched exactly against the loader's original
  output and TAWOS's published totals.

No discrepancy was found in any check.

## 13. Security, Multi-Tenancy & Production Concerns

- **Multi-tenancy from the ground up:** every model and query is organization-scoped; tenant
  isolation is enforced at the query layer, not bolted on.
- **Auth:** JWT (HS256) with access + refresh tokens; refresh rotation; credentials transmitted in
  request bodies (a login-in-the-query-string vulnerability was found and fixed during
  development — §6.5).
- **Secret hygiene:** the default JWT secret is asserted to differ from the shipped development
  default whenever `ENVIRONMENT != "development"`.
- **Dialect-neutral persistence:** models avoid Postgres-only types so the same code paths run
  against SQLite in CI and Postgres in production — no divergent "works in tests, breaks in
  prod" surface.
- **Async-first:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + `asyncpg` throughout the core API for
  concurrency under load.
- **Stated, not hidden, limitation:** fine-grained role-based authorization is not yet enforced —
  the MVP guarantee is *authenticated + org-scoped*, nothing finer. This is explicitly documented
  rather than silently assumed, and is covered by a tenant-isolation test (`Org B cannot read Org
  A's project/task/run → 404 on all three`).

---

## 14. Limitations & Threats to Validity

- **RBAC is not enforced at fine granularity yet** (§13) — a known, documented MVP boundary.
- **Only one of six risk types has real-world (non-synthetic) validation** (§12.6) — the other
  five are validated only against deterministic synthetic scenarios, which check implementation
  correctness, not generalization.
- **The real-world delay label is a proxy**, not the canonical "past due date" definition, because
  the dataset used lacks due dates.
- **No live-LLM evaluation metrics** — schema-validity rate and fallback-agreement (Cohen's κ)
  between the rule-based and LLM paths are designed but unmeasured, since they require ongoing
  API access.
- **Two of the eleven originally designed agents (Meeting Intelligence, Communication
  Intelligence) are unimplemented** because their required input sources don't exist in the
  product yet — an explicit scoping decision, not a silent gap.
- **Single LLM provider** (Groq/Llama) — cross-provider robustness is untested.
- **No longitudinal or live user study** — usefulness of recommendations to real project managers
  is not yet measured empirically; this is the most promising near-term addition for a stronger
  paper (§16).

---

## 15. Related Work Positioning

For a Related Work section, the system should be positioned against three groups:

1. **Traditional PM tools** (Jira, Linear, Asana, Monday.com) — these surface *current state* but
   not predictive, evidence-linked risk; "at risk" flags, where present, are opaque.
2. **Academic/industrial multi-agent systems** (AutoGPT, MetaGPT, ChatDev, AgentBench-style
   benchmarks) — these generally optimize for task completion by LLM agents, not for
   *deterministic, checkable* risk computation with an LLM narrating rather than deciding.
3. **XAI techniques in software engineering** (SHAP/LIME-based defect prediction, explainable
   effort estimation) — these explain a model's own prediction; this system's contribution is
   different in kind — the risk computation itself is not a learned model needing post-hoc
   explanation, it is a deterministic graph invariant, and the LLM's role is narration under a
   mechanically enforced citation constraint.

The differentiating combination to state explicitly: **specialist multi-agent decomposition +
graph-computed (not LLM-inferred) risk + mechanically enforced evidence grounding + deterministic
fallback with an identical schema + a held-out real-world evaluation including reported negative
results.** No single comparator combines all five.

---

## 16. Future Work

- **Meeting Intelligence** — transcript ingestion; evaluation against the AMI Meeting Corpus
  (~100h, gold-labeled decisions/action-items/problems) since its label shape matches
  `MeetingIntelOutput` almost directly. Adds `Meeting`/`Decision` nodes to the graph.
- **Communication Intelligence** — chat/email event ingestion; evaluation against the Enron Email
  Corpus. Adds `COMMUNICATED_WITH` edges, which would substantially strengthen the coordination
  and silent-member risk types (currently the weakest-validated, per §12.6).
- **Persistent graph backend** — Neo4j/Cypher, if a longitudinal or cross-project graph story is
  wanted; the `GraphBuilder` interface is already kept swappable for this.
- **Fine-grained RBAC** completion, Organizational Memory/RAG (currently stubbed), Team
  Intelligence Index (designed, blocked on Comm Intel + Memory being live).
- **Live-LLM metrics**: schema-validity rate, fallback-vs-LLM agreement (Cohen's κ), under
  production traffic.
- **Individualized due-date estimation revisited** with a better duration proxy than raw story
  points, given that attempt 2 in §12.5 showed the *idea* is directionally right but the *proxy*
  used was too noisy.
- **Human-in-the-loop study**: PM ratings of recommendation usefulness, false-alarm tolerance in
  practice, and whether recall-first (current operating point) is actually preferred to a more
  balanced precision/recall trade-off.
- **Causal / counterfactual recommendations** and **transfer learning** across projects, once more
  real-world data is available beyond the single TAWOS split.
- **Scale targets** stated for a production deployment story: 10K users, 1K organizations, <30s
  full analysis, sub-second p95 API latency.

## 18. Paper-Writing Prompt Templates

Use these as prompts to draft each section, feeding this dossier as context.

**Abstract:** "Write a 200-word abstract for a paper describing TeamSync AI: an explainable
multi-agent platform that predicts team coordination failures via a knowledge-graph core (six
risk types computed as deterministic graph invariants) plus specialist LLM agents that narrate
findings under a mechanically enforced evidence-grounding constraint. State the two central
measured results: 99.8% prompt-token reduction vs. a naive baseline while project size grows
154×, and a held-out real-world evaluation (TAWOS, 458K Jira issues) where the zero-parameter
graph rule warns of late sprints at their halfway point (AUC 0.792, rising to 0.874 at
three-quarters) and matches a tuned learned model at sprint end on unseen projects."

**Introduction:** problem (§1) → gap vs. existing tools (§15) → approach (§3, §5) →
contributions (§3.1–3.5) → paper structure.

**Related Work:** build the three-way comparison table from §15.

**System Architecture:** §4, with the service diagram and request-flow sequence reproduced as
figures.

**Core Contribution — Graph-Grounded Agent Prompting:** §5 in full, including the two bugs found
and fixed (unbounded witness growth, empty-findings grounding bug) as evidence of rigor.

**Multi-Agent Design:** §6, with the `AgentOutput` schema and coordinator pseudocode as a figure.

**Evaluation:** §12 in full — do not omit §12.5 (negative results) or §12.6 (threats to
validity); the paper's strongest defensible claim is *"a simple, explainable, zero-parameter graph
rule matches a tuned learned model on unseen projects, and warns halfway through a sprint rather
than after it"* — state exactly that, no more, and avoid "beats": the paired test returns *p* = 0.78.

**Discussion:** §14 limitations, ethical considerations (risk-scoring people carries surveillance
and fairness concerns — an explicit paragraph is warranted), generalizability to non-software
team domains (sales, support, research teams — the graph schema is domain-agnostic).

**Future Work:** §16, prioritizing Meeting/Communication Intelligence and the human-in-the-loop
study as the two additions with the strongest research payoff.

**Conclusion:** restate the two headline empirical results and the one-sentence takeaway: risk
detection can be made both cheap (graph-computed) and trustworthy (mechanically grounded)
without sacrificing accuracy to a more complex learned model.

## 19. Glossary

- **Witness subgraph** — the bounded k-hop neighborhood around an anomalous node, extracted and
  shown to the LLM instead of the full project dataset.
- **Grounding** — the mechanical check that every evidence citation in an agent's output resolves
  to a real node id within its witness subgraph; ungrounded citations are stripped, not merely
  discouraged.
- **Fallback** — a deterministic, rule-based implementation of an agent's logic used when the LLM
  is unavailable or fails, sharing the exact same output schema as the LLM path.
- **SPOF** — single point of failure; in this system, an articulation point in the Person↔
  Component graph projection.
- **TAWOS** — the public Jira issue-tracking dataset (Tawosi et al., MSR 2022) used for the
  real-world evaluation in §12.4.
- **AgentRun** — the persisted record of one coordinator execution: specialist outputs, risk
  scores, recommendations, and the witness subgraph that produced them.
- **Point-in-time reconstruction** — rebuilding a task's historical state as of a specific past
  moment (sprint end) to avoid leaking future/resolved status into a retrospective evaluation
  label.
